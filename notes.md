# Installation process problems
- Ran into a problem with installing requirements needed to use this command
    - ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt --user```
- Ran into a problem installing django too
    - ```pip3 install django --user```
- Problem with installing pillow
    - Per the forums took out the versioning number in ./server/requirements.txt
- 03052023 Completed and tested all items in module 1. 
    - Took all requested screenshots
    - Everything for module 1 located in the module 1 folder
    - Git commit and push done
- 03062023
    - Completed the User Management half of the module
        - Created the superuser
        - Created the login, logout, and registration modules
        - pushed code changes up to github
    - Completed the CICD half of the module
        - Note that the banner to manually run the workflow never appeared for me
        - Could not find any threads in the forums or any information online about why except a vague possibility that something wasn't defaulted to the correct default branch name (this one is still legacy master)
        - The linter DID run correctly on push so I am considering this module complete
